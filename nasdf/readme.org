#+TITLE: NASDF

NASDF is an ASDF extension providing utilities to ease system setup, testing
and installation.

** Features

- Simple way to fetch Git submodules and "do the right thing" for setup.  This
  may effectively supersede Quicklisp.  A benefit of using Git submodules over
  the default Quicklisp distribution is improved reproducibility.
- Test helpers, like distinction between offline and online tests, or continuous
  integration options, and warning reports.
- Installation helpers, for instance to install libraries, icons and desktop
  files to the right directories.

See [[file:package.lisp]] for more details.

** Environment variables

NASDF exposes some environment variables which can be convenient in some cases
(say for continuous integration) to tweak some options.

- =NASDF_SOURCE_PATH= :: See =nasdf:*dest-source-dir*=.
- =NASDF_SUBMODULES_DIR= :: See =nasdf:*submodules-directory*=.
- =NASDF_SUBMODULES_JOBS= :: See =nasdf:*submodules-jobs*=.
- =NASDF_USE_LOGICAL_PATHS= :: Allow non-expanded logical pathnames in system
  pathnames.
  This is particularly useful when shipping the source.
  Disable it if your tooling (e.g. SLIME) encounters issues to find the
  definition of symbols.
  See =asdf:nasdf-file=.
- =NASDF_COMPRESS= :: Compress the application executable.
  Only works with some compilers like SBCL.  May increase startup time.
  See =asdf:nasdf-file=.
- =NASDF_TESTS_NO_NETWORK= :: Do no run tests that have the =:online= tag.
  See =nasdf:nasdf-test-system=.
- =NASDF_TESTS_QUIT_ON_FAIL= :: Quit the Lisp on test failure.  This is useful
  to tell the continuous integration environment that tests failed, otherwise
  they silently fail.

All boolean environment variables try to be smart enough to understand what you
mean; for instance both =on= and =true= are valid values to enable the feature.

** History

NASDF was originally developed for [[https://nyxt-browser.com][Nyxt]].
